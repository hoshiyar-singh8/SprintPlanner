# Changelog

## v1.4.7 (2026-03-17)

### Changed: Global MCP Setup

- MCPs now install directly into `~/.claude.json` at the global level — **works across all Claude accounts**
- Switched to remote HTTP MCPs (no npx, no API tokens needed at install time)
  - Figma MCP → `https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`
  - Atlassian MCP → `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp`
  - Slack MCP → `https://mcp.slack.com/mcp` (new)
- Auth happens via OAuth on first use inside Claude — no credentials in install script
- Replaced GitHub npx MCP (PAT-based) with simpler remote MCPs

## v1.4.6 (2026-03-17)

### Added: Push Log with Clickable Jira Links

- After pushing tickets, generates `push_log.md` with a table of all created tickets and clickable Jira URLs
- Updates `pipeline_state.yaml` with `push_status: pushed` (or `partial` if some failed)
- Console output shows URLs as tickets are created
- Appends to existing log when pushing in multiple rounds (e.g., HeroGen first, Human later)

## v1.4.5 (2026-03-17)

### Fixed: Smart Resume — Detect Unpushed Tickets

- On `/run-pipeline`, checks for previous completed pipelines with unpushed tickets
- If found: asks "Would you like to push them to Jira now?" — simple yes/no
- YES → verifies Atlassian MCP / Jira credentials → jumps to push stage
- NO → starts fresh pipeline, old artifacts preserved
- No more silently restarting Stage 0 when tickets are waiting to be pushed

## v1.4.4 (2026-03-17)

### Fixed: Eliminate Security Warnings in Pipeline Agents

- All 9 agents now have **Tool Usage Rules** banning inline Python (`python3 -c "..."`) and `${VAR}` Bash substitution — both trigger Claude Code security prompts
- Agents must use Read/Write tools for file I/O and `printenv` for env var checks
- Orchestrator Jira credential check uses `printenv` instead of `${JIRA_*:-NOT_SET}` pattern

## v1.4.3 (2026-03-17)

### Fixed: MCP Prerequisite Gate

- MCP health check is now a **blocking prerequisite** before Stage 0 — no more silent skipping
- If MCPs are missing: guides user to run `./install.sh --setup-mcps`, then restart the Claude session
- Pipeline only proceeds if MCPs are confirmed available OR user **explicitly** opts out
- Shows clear status table (✅/❌) for GitHub, Figma, and Atlassian MCPs

## v1.4.2 (2026-03-17)

### Fixed: Pipeline Reliability

- **Stage 0 interactive Q&A** — enforced one-question-at-a-time flow with explicit "STOP and wait" after each step. Stage 0 now feels like a natural conversation, not a batch job.
- **Stage 4→5 sequential execution** — classifier can no longer launch in parallel with the breakdown agent. Added validation gate between stages.
- **YAML schema contract** — added explicit field name spec to prevent agent drift (`id` not `task_id`, `execution_mode.type` not `mode`). Validators reject non-conforming fields.

## v1.4.1 (2026-03-17)

### Added: Self-Updating Upgrade Path

- `./install.sh --update` — pulls latest from `origin/main` and reinstalls (skips MCP setup)
- `./install.sh --check` — fetches remote and shows if an update is available
- `./install.sh --setup-mcps` — runs only the MCP interactive setup (for adding skipped MCPs later)
- Version tracking file (`~/.claude/.sprint-planner-version`) — records installed version, source path, and timestamp
- Install now shows "Upgrading: v1.x → v1.y" or "reinstalling" when a previous version is detected
- Uninstall now cleans up the version tracking file

## v1.4.0 (2026-03-17)

### Added: Automated MCP Installation

- `install.sh` — interactive MCP setup: detects missing MCPs, prompts to install with credential collection
  - **GitHub MCP** (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`) — prompts for GitHub PAT
  - **Figma MCP** (`figma-developer-mcp`) — prompts for Figma API key
  - **Atlassian MCP** (`atlassian-mcp`) — prompts for site URL, email, API token
- All MCPs installed as user-scoped (`-s user`) so they work across all projects
- Skipped MCPs can be installed later by re-running `./install.sh`
- macOS bash 3 compatible (no `${var,,}` bashisms)

### Improved
- `pipeline-orchestrator` — MCP health check now includes Atlassian MCP awareness; falls back to REST API hooks when MCP unavailable
- `run-pipeline` SKILL.md — updated MCP install commands with correct package names
- `README.md` — MCP table updated to reflect automated setup

## v1.3.2 (2026-03-17)

### Improved: New User Onboarding

**MCP Dependency Handling:**
- `install.sh` — checks for GitHub MCP and Figma MCP at install time, shows install commands if missing
- `pipeline-orchestrator` — MCP health check before Stage 0: detects missing MCPs, guides user to install or switch to alternatives
- `pipeline-orchestrator` — MCP fallback chain: GitHub MCP → `gh` CLI → local path; Figma MCP → manual specs → skip
- `README.md` — added optional MCP prerequisites table with install commands

**Stuck-Pipeline Recovery:**
- `pipeline-orchestrator` — rules 11-12: always explain what failed and why, offer concrete next steps, never silently hang
- `run-pipeline` SKILL.md — added MCP health check section, updated error handling with fallback chains

**Other:**
- `install.sh` — fixed VERSION (was stale at 1.1.0, now 1.3.2)
- `run-pipeline` SKILL.md — updated Stage 8 push strategy to match orchestrator (6 options, not 3)

## v1.3.1 (2026-03-17)

### Fixed (from pipeline test run with real RFC)

**Validators:**
- `validate_clarifications.py` — warns when `## Requirements` table with R-IDs is missing (needed for downstream tracing)
- `validate_context.py` — checks `key_files` paths against actual repo on disk (warns on missing files when `repo_source: local`)
- `validate_plan.py` — warns when phase details lack file path references (anti-hallucination: planner must cite context_pack files)

**Quality Gate:**
- `quality_gate.py` — new requirement coverage check: cross-references R-IDs from `clarifications.md` against `task_specs.yaml` requirement_ids. Warns on uncovered requirements. (15 checks total, up from 14)

**Push Strategy:**
- `plan_push_strategy.py` — sprint capacity algorithm now prefers completing dependency chains over picking independent tasks. Uses iterative selection scoring: chain continuation > downstream unlock value > topo order
- `render_jira_payload.py` — now copies `execution_mode` from task_specs to jira_payload.json, fixing `--filter herogen|human` on `create_jira_tickets.py`

## v1.3.0 (2026-03-17)

### Added: Push Strategy
- `plan_push_strategy.py` — new hook that plans which tickets to push based on strategy (full plan, sprint capacity, herogen only, human only, cherry-pick)
- Sprint discovery in `jira_auto_config.py` — discovers boards, active/future sprints from Jira Agile API
- `create_jira_tickets.py` — new flags: `--filter herogen|human|TASK-IDs`, `--sprint <id>`, `--push-plan <file>`
- `pipeline-orchestrator` — Stage 8 push strategy with 6 options and sprint assignment
- 14 new tests for push strategy (topological sort, capacity planning, filtering, dependency inclusion)

### Improved: Anti-Hallucination
- `validate_task_specs.py` — `requirement_ids` is now a hard error (was warning). Every task must trace to an RFC requirement.
- `pipeline-planner` — 4 new grounding rules: every phase must cite reference files from context_pack, architecture decisions must cite real code paths, SP estimates must explain complexity signals, never reference undiscovered files
- `pipeline-breakdown` — 4 new anti-hallucination rules: `files_to_modify` paths must exist in context_pack, `files_to_create` must follow existing directory structure, `reference_file` must exist in key_files, `requirement_ids` must trace to RFC

## v1.2.0 (2026-03-17)

### Improved (based on analysis of 60+ real HeroGen PRs — diffs, reviews, closed vs merged)

**Ticket Quality (from real merged vs closed patterns):**
- `jira-ticket-standard` — rewritten with evidence-based templates, common review rework section (iOS style rules IOS-0002/0009, Android optional defaults, mapper completeness)
- `herogen-task-safety` — Android MVVM classification, file-count heuristic, granularity check, common rework patterns, PR success metrics table, platform-specific test conventions
- `pipeline-jira-writer` — three concrete ticket templates, platform-specific anti-patterns (iOS no UI tests, Android CODEOWNERS/TUIT/diff coverage), mapper field enumeration rule
- `pipeline-classifier` — granularity warnings before classification, Android layer support, file-count validation

**Task Decomposition (from closed batch #35661-35668 vs merged replacements #35660/35708/35778):**
- `task-decomposition-rules` — vertical-slice decomposition rule (the #1 finding), wrong-vs-right comparison table, feature flag cleanup pattern, independently-shippable task requirement
- `pipeline-breakdown` — vertical-slice enforcement, Android API/Impl module pattern, TODO stubs behind flags, mapper completeness rule, file count guidance
- `pipeline-planner` — mandatory Task Granularity Guidance section

**Validation:**
- `validate_classification.py` — warns when herogen task modifies 4+ existing files
- `validate_task_specs.py` — vague acceptance criteria detection, dependency chain depth warning (5+ = horizontal slicing), `cleanup` layer added
- `validate_plan.py` — warns when Task Granularity Guidance section is missing
- `pipeline-validator` — 7 new quality checks (mapper completeness, iOS no-UI-tests, file count, chain depth, independent shippability, cleanup completeness, no YAGNI params)

## v1.1.0 (2026-03-17)

### Added
- `create_jira_tickets.py` — push tickets directly to Jira API with `--dry-run` support
- `pipeline_summary.py` — quick summary utility for any feature directory
- Test suite (39 tests) covering validators, Jira renderer, and quality gate
- GitHub Actions CI with Python 3.9-3.12 matrix
- `.gitignore` for Python artifacts and user config
- Requirements traceability: R1/R2 IDs from RFC through tasks to tickets
- Fit-check table pattern in planner for multi-approach comparison
- Screen states section in context_pack.yaml for UI features
- `--version` flag for install.sh
- CI badge in README

### Fixed
- `quality_gate.py` — now uses `detected_platform` instead of `platform` field
- `render_jira_payload.py` — regex correctly strips colon from `TASK-001:` headers
- `validate_context.py` — added 10 more valid architecture patterns (bloc, hexagonal, layered, etc.)
- `install.sh` — cross-platform sed (works on both macOS and Linux)

### Improved
- `pipeline-skill-generator` — enhanced Android detection (Anvil/Whetstone DI, MockK, Turbine, VariationKey)
- `pipeline-breakdown` — platform-specific layer documentation (iOS/Android/Web/Backend)
- `pipeline-orchestrator` — Jira push option after quality gate
- `pipeline-discovery` — explicit numbered requirements extraction for traceability
- `pipeline-planner` — fit-check table for architecture approach comparison
- `pipeline-validator` — requirements coverage cross-check
